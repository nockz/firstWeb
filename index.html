        <h2>The Real Card</h2>
        <p>To my beautiful little princess,<br><br>
            Happy birthday my beautiful little baby girl! I love you so so much and I hope you have an amazing birthday party. You really deserve the best party.<br>

            Anyways, I’m so blessed to have you in my life and I love every moment that I either get to talk to you or even better, be with you.<br>As I have said time and time before, you truly have made me the best version of myself and I am so thankful for having your beautiful self in my life.<br>You’re the most beautiful, sweet, funny, and everything girl ever. I dont think I can emphasize how perfect you are at the end of the day baby.<br>It’s so amazing to have you in my life and I hope you know that.<br>
            
            I’m sorry that I haven’t been the greatest for you recently but baby, I promise that this next year with you being 17 will be full of me treating you the absolute best I can. And every other year after that lol but you get the point.<br>
            
            Im going to stop yapping now baby but I hope you know you are my world and I love you so so much.<br>I don’t think there’s any number of kisses or any number of hours of cuddling that can truly represent how much I love you.<br>I hope you have an amazing year being 17 years old, and I can’t wait to spend it with you.</p>

Anyways, I was thinking later I'll get a better URL for this website and we can make this website for the sole purpose of keeping stuff for us.<br>Oh, and I'll make it require a password because I don't want some random people stumbling upon our stuff lol</p>
